# cyclone_rs
A Rust-lang migration of the Cyclone physics engine built here: [Game Physics Engine Development](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768)

## In-Progress
Currently finishing up chapter 6. I need to make tests for springs before moving on.

### Refactor Notes
- [ ] Apparently [Rust 2018](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/Rust-1.31-and-rust-2018.html) is a thing and I should probably update the code to the latest guidelines.
